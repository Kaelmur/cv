	Also I have the Arcana on this hero, its simply makes animation prettier and comfortable for me. I have 300 games on this hero,
	which is small amount comparing to games that I have in total, but its simple hero which makes easier to learn play, and also
	this hero don't require micro skill. My winrate on this hero for 100 recent games is 64%.</li>

Average GPM is 680 which is good cuz,
	this hero don't have a good farm skills, so you have almost always buy BF. I have 500 games on this hero, its also simple
	hero in micro, but in macro you should be aware almost everytime, cuz few deaths, and you lost. My winrate on this hero for
	100 recent games is 55 %.
